      <p id="intro">Hi, my name is Mina Ghaly.
        I started my career when I joined the bootcamp program in may 2022.
        We studied there Javascript, html, css, express and react in depth. With this syllabus, 
        I became very good in all these fields. In addition to that, I am 
        planning to study php as well by the end of 2022 to have an excellent protofolio.</p>
