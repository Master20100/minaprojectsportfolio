      <p>
      Hi, my name is Mina Ghaly.
      I started my career when I joined the bootcamp program in may 2022.
      We studied there Javascript, html, css, express and react in depth. With this syllabus, 
      I became very good in all these fields. In addition to that, I am 
      planning to study php as well by the end of 2022 to have an excellent protofolio.
